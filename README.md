# C Master Toolkit

![C Master Toolkit](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%20Master-Toolkit-blue?logo=c)

A comprehensive **command-line interface (CLI)** application that demonstrates core C programming concepts‚Äîfrom basic I/O and control flow to data structures, file handling, and dynamic programming. Perfect for learners who want a hands-on, modular toolkit to explore and showcase their C skills.

## üåü Overview

`c-master-toolkit` is a unified CLI application that encapsulates six mini-projects, each targeting a fundamental C topic:

* **Calculator**: Basic arithmetic operations with input validation.
* **Number Guessing Game**: Randomized game loop using `rand()` and `time()`.
* **To-Do List Manager**: Dynamic linked list manipulation with `malloc`/`free`.
* **Student Record Manager**: Binary file I/O for persisting structured data.
* **Array & String Utilities**: Functions for reversing strings, finding min/max, and bubble sort.
* **Dynamic Programming Demo**: Recursive vs. memoized Fibonacci to illustrate DP benefits.

By selecting an option from the main menu, you can dive into each module, run its logic, and then return seamlessly to the main menu.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Modular Design**: Each feature lives in its own source file (`src/*.c`), wired together via a central dispatcher in `main.c`.
* **Clear Menus & Prompts**: User-friendly text UI with input validation and error handling.
* **Lightweight**: Pure C (C99), no external dependencies beyond the standard library.
* **Educational**: Well-commented code and demonstration of best practices.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

* **GCC** compiler (supports C99) or compatible
* **Make** (optional, but recommended for easy builds)
* Basic familiarity with command-line operations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Build

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the ZIP and extract):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/c-master-toolkit.git
   cd c-master-toolkit
   ```

2. **Build with Make** (recommended):

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Or compile directly with GCC**:

   ```bash
   gcc -std=c99 -I include src/*.c -o c-master-toolkit
   ```

4. **Run the executable**:

   ```bash
   ./c-master-toolkit    # Unix/macOS
   c-master-toolkit.exe  # Windows
   ```
